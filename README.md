## Hi, I’m Ramzi Masri, a second-year Data Science and Economics student at Northeastern University. 
I’m interested in data analysis and its approach to creative decision making. I’ve been learning Objected Oriented Java design and Matrices in my coursework. 

A few years ago, I took a small internship at an investment and shareholder company and learned how they analyze data of medical companies and consider further investment or not. Last semester, I presented the consequences of disinformation with a partner and included data on disinformation found on social media and news articles. We also discussed possible solutions to prevent disinformation based on the data gathered. 

I want to take an internship where I can improve my skills in data analysis and decision making in either social or economic scenarios.
